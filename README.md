# Crowdin .NET client (v1)

The Crowdin .NET client is a lightweight interface to the Crowdin API v1. It provides common services for making API requests.

Our API is a full-featured RESTful API that helps you to integrate localization into your development process. The endpoints that we use allow you to easily make calls to retrieve information and to execute actions needed.

For more about Crowdin API v1 see the [documentation](https://support.crowdin.com/api/api-integration-setup/).

### Requirements

* .NET Core - 2.1
* C# language version - 7.3

## Installation

1. Install via Nuget [TBA]
2. Download this library to your project's 3rd party libraries path:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-dotnet-client-php.git </your-project/src/Crowdin.Api>
    ```

    include library:

    ```C#
    <ItemGroup>

### Quick Start

The API client must be instantiated and configured before calling any API method.

```C#

var httpClient = new HttpClient {BaseAddress = new Uri(Configuration["api"])};
var crowdin = new Client(httpClient);

var projectId = Configuration["project:projectId"];
var projectCredentials = GetConfigValue<ProjectCredentials>("project");

ProjectInfo project = await crowdin.GetProjectInfo(projectId, projectCredentials);

ConsoleOutput(project);
```
